1. Write a Pascal program that could be used to generate squares of even integers between 
12 and 30. Use Repeatâ€¦ Until loop.

2.  The interest accrued I for a principal interest amount P after period of time T at the rate R 
is given by the formula

```Pascal
 I=P*R*T. 
```
  Write a Pascal program that prompts a user to enter the 
  principal amount in the main program and then  pass this value to a procedure named 
  compute. 

 The procedure calculates the interest at a rate of 12% per annum for a period of 
  5 years. The procedure then returns the interest to the main program for output.
