## Question 1
State 5 advantages of topdown modular  structured programming , discuss each in your own words

**Solution**

1. It supports modularity :
*Breaking a problem down into smaller tasks makes it far easier to understand, solve and manage moreso in areas involving large linesof code where effeciecny needs to be optimized* 

2. It also suppports collaboration on projects *This form of design allows several programmers to work on the same project without much of confusion*

3. Logical structures ensure clear flow of control : *which is essential incase of explaining code to others*
4. Modules can be re-used many times : *thus it saves time, reduces complexity and increase reliability.*
5. Updating code is easier : *Easier to update the program by replacing individual modules rather than larger amount of code.*
